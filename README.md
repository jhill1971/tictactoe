# Tic Tac Toe Game
# By James Hill

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns and play Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 grid.

## Code Structure

- **Global Variables:**
  - `turn`: Keeps track of the current turn number.
  - `grid`: A list representing the Tic Tac Toe grid.
  - `player1symbol`, `player2symbol`: Symbols ("X" and "O") for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
  - `playing`: A flag to control the game loop.

- **Functions:**
  - `playfield()`: Prints the current state of the game grid.
  - `player_one()`: Manages Player 1's turn.
  - `player_two()`: Manages Player 2's turn.
  - `gameover()`: Ends the game and exits the program.

## Future Improvements

- Add a feature to check for a winner before all turns are exhausted.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Enhance error handling and input validation.
